### Example 1: A Muslim president?

A survey of 1,527 American adults conducted in June 2015 stated that 60% would vote for a qualified Muslim presidential candidate.  The survey goes on to say that “… the margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.”

(a). What is the relevant sample statistic?  Give appropriate notation and the value of the statistic.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:*  $\hat{p} = 0.60$
</details><br>

(b).  What population parameter are we estimating with this sample statistic?  
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* p = the proportion of all American adults who vote for a qualified Muslim candidate
</details><br>

(c).  Use the margin of error to give a confidence interval for the population parameter and interpret this interval in context. 
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $0.60 \pm .03$ gives an interval from 0.57 to 0.63
I am 95% confident that the proportion of American adults who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate is between 57% and 63%.
</details><br>

(d). Is it reasonable to say that a majority of American adults would vote for a qualified presidential candidate? (Is 0.50 a plausible value?)
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* The proportion of all Americans who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate is likely between 57% and 63%, so we could say that majority (>50%) would vote for a Muslim candidate.
</details><br>

(e).  Explain what “95% confidence” mean for this example. (Don’t just repeat your answer to 1c.)
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* About 95% of all samples of 1527 American adults will give us a sample proportion who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate that is within 3% of the population proportion who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate.

### Example 2: Biomass in Tropical Forests

Using a random sample of 4079 inventory plots, scientists found a sample average of 11,600 tons of carbon per square kilometer with a standard error of 1000 tons. Give a 95% confidence interval for the mean amount of carbon per square kilometer in tropical forests.  Clearly interpret the meaning of this confidence interval. 

<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $11,600 \pm 2(1000)$ gives an interval from 9,600 to 13,600. We are 95% sure that the mean amount of carbon per square kilometer in all tropical forests is between 9,600 and 13,600 tons.

### Example 3: Change in gun ownership?

A 2016 study described in The Guardian found that a random sample of US adults in 1994 found a female rate of gun ownership of 9%. A similar random sample in 2015 found the rate of female gun ownership rose to 12%. Though not given in the article, let’s assume that the SE for the difference in these two sample proportions is 2%. 

 (a). Use correct notation to describe our parameter of interest: the difference in the proportion of female gun owners in 1994 and 2015.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $\hat{p}_{1994} - \hat{p}_{2015}$ 
</details><br>

 (b). Use the data collected to estimate your parameter in (a) and use correct notation for this statistic.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $\hat{p}_{1994} - \hat{p}_{2015}$ = 0.09 - 0.12 = -0.03
</details><br>

 (c).  Compute a 95% confidence interval for the parameter in a.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $(0.09 - 0.12) \pm (.02) = -0.03 \pm 0.04 = -0.07 \text{ to } 0.01, or -7\% \text{ to } 1\%$
</details><br>

 (d). Interpret your interval in c and explain why this support the authors claim that “the increase [in female gun ownership] was not meaningful.”
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* We are 95% confident that the female gun owner rate in 1994 could be 7 percentage point lower to 1 percentage point higher than the rate in 2015. We can say that the observed increase from 1994 to 2015 of 3% is not “statistically significant” because it is within the margin of error (4%) for this study.

### Example 4: Interpreting a Confidence Interval

Using a sample of 24 deliveries described in “Diary of a Pizza Girl” on the Slice website, we find a 95% confidence interval for the mean tip given for a pizza delivery to be $2.18 to $3.90.  Which of the following is a correct interpretation of this interval?  Indicate all that are correct interpretations. 

 (a).  I am 95% sure that all pizza delivery tips will be between  $2.18 and $3.90.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* Incorrect.  The interval is about the mean, not individual tips..
</details><br>

 (b). 95% of all pizza delivery tips will be between  $2.18 and $3.90.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* I am 95% sure that the mean  pizza delivery tip for this sample will be between  $2.18 and $3.90.
</details><br>

 (c). I am 95% sure that the mean tip for all pizza deliveries in this area will be between  $2.18 and $3.90.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:*  Correct!
</details><br>

 (d). I am 95% sure that the confidence interval for the mean pizza delivery tip will be between  $2.18 and $3.90. 
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* Incorrect.  The confidence is in where the population mean is, not where the interval itself is.
