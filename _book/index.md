# Introduction to Statistics {-}

Welcome to the captivating world of statistics! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you'll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in data analysis, statistical inference, and randomness. Some of the areas we'll delve into include linear regression, experimental design, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and the bootstrap method.

Although statistics is a field that relies on mathematics, it stands apart as a distinct discipline. At the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you'll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it's crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.


## Learning Objectives

<blockquote>
- Learn basic principles of data analysis, and how data is produced and used in studies and experiments.

- Understand role of variation and randomness. Understand principles of inference: confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

- Develop ability to examine statistical arguments critically.

- Learn how to use software (R/RStudio) to analyze data, create graphs, perform basic statistical tests
