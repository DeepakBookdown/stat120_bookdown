First save quantitative variable size new variable called mysize:find mean values:sample mean (truly random sample) compare sample mean non-random sample?Answer: true mean 4.29. two means likely vary. Since many non-random samples generally overestimated population mean length, possible (guaranteed) one non-random sample gave mean length greater random sample’s mean length.","code":"\npop <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/GettysbergPopulationCounts.csv\")\nhead(pop)  position size  word\n1        1    4  Four\n2        2    5 score\n3        3    3   and\n4        4    5 seven\n5        5    5 years\n6        6    3  ago,\nsamp <- sample(1:268, size=10)\nsamp [1] 170 201 264 221 130 241 137 214  93 123\npop[samp,]    position size      word\n170      170    9 dedicated\n201      201    6    before\n264      264    3       not\n221      221    4      full\n130      130    2       it,\n241      241    6   nation,\n137      137    3       add\n214      214    5     cause\n93        93    2        is\n123      123    3       and\nmysize <- pop[samp, \"size\"]\nmysize [1] 9 6 3 4 2 6 3 5 2 3\nmean(mysize)[1] 4.3"},{"path":"practice-problems-3.html","id":"practice-problems-3","chapter":"7 Practice Problems 3","heading":"7 Practice Problems 3","text":"","code":""},{"path":"practice-problems-3.html","id":"case-study-1","chapter":"7 Practice Problems 3","heading":"7.1 Case Study 1","text":"Consider following case study:\n“Researchers want find new diet affects weight gain among underweight subjects. experiment two treatment conditions, new diet standard diet. study, researchers recruited 200 subjects grouped 100 pairs based shared characteristics age, gender, weight, height, lifestyle, . 20-year-old female within weight range 90-110 pounds height range 60-63 inches paired another 20-year-old female falls weight height categories. 100 pairs made, subject pair randomly assigned treatment group (administered new diet 2 months) subject pair assigned control group (assigned follow standard diet two months). end time time period 2 months, researchers measure total weight gain subject.”Observed data:\nresearchers found 60 100 subjects new diet group showed substantial improvement, compared 43 100 subjects standard diet group.\n(b).
