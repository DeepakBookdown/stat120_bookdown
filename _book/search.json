Bar graph one variableWe can create data frame count_data containing counts corresponding categories., use ggplot2 create bar plot categories x-axis counts y-axis. column names count_data automatically assigned Var1 Freq. can change column names category count, example, :geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") function used create bars, set y-axis label using labs().may simply use geom_bar count data available.(d). Two-way tablesFirst 10 entries race struck_state variable isThe table command also gives two-way tables two variables included. two-way table juror race state struck status:many jurors white struck state?(e).
