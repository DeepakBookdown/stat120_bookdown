# Homework Guidelines

- You **can** discuss homework problems with classmates, but you must write up **your own** homework solutions and **do your own work in R (no sharing commands or output) unless explicitly told otherwise**.
- **Getting help**: You **can** use the following resources to complete your homework:
  - Carleton faculty (myself, other stat faculty, etc)
  - Discussions with classmates (see above) or knowledgeable friends
  - The math skills center
  - Lab assistants (in CMC 304)
  - Prefects
  - Student solutions provided in the back of your student textbook or in the student solution manual
  - It is okay to get coding help from prefects, tutors, classmates, online resources, but extra care should be done to write your own versions of the codes.
- You **cannot** use any resources other than the ones listed above to complete assignments (homework, reports, etc) for this class. E.g. you cannot use a friend's old assignments or reports, answers found on the internet, textbook (instructor) solutions manual, etc.

## Format

- At the top of each assignment, provide the following details:
  - Class name (e.g., Stat xxx)
  - Homework number (e.g., "homework 1")
  - Your name
  - The names of classmates that you worked with on all or part of the assignment
- Turn in a neat, **correctly ordered**, and **legible** assignment with no ragged edges. If it can't be read, it will not be graded.
- **Staple** - no folded corners accepted!

## Content

- You must **show all work** and formulas used to answer any question which requires a numerical answer. Be sure to show the natural sequence of work needed to answer the problem.
- Use **complete sentences** when answering any problem that requires an explanation or overall problem summary.

## Problems using R

- These problems must be written up as Word or pdf document using R Markdown.
- **Label** all output with the problem number.
- First **give your answer to a problem in written form**, never just give R output as your answer. Follow your written answer with your "work" which contains **all relevant R commands and output** (numeric output or graphs) that are needed to answer a homework problem. Do not include typos or unnecessary commands/output.
