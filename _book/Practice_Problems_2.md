## Problem 1

### Gettysburg random sample

Let’s take a simple random sample (SRS) of Gettysburg words. The “population” is contained in the
spreadsheet `GettysburgPopulationCounts.csv`. Carefully load this data into R:



```r
pop <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/GettysbergPopulationCounts.csv")
head(pop)
```

```
  position size  word
1        1    4  Four
2        2    5 score
3        3    3   and
4        4    5 seven
5        5    5 years
6        6    3  ago,
```

The `position` variable enumerates the list of words in the population (address).

(a). Sample

Run the following command to obtain a SRS of 10 words from the 268 that are in the population:


```r
samp <- sample(1:268, size=10)
samp
```

```
 [1] 136 112 181 205 131  85  13 208 100 178
```

This tells you the position (row number) of your sampled words. What are your sampled positions? Why are your sampled positions different from other folks in class?

(b). Get words and lengths

We will *subset* the data set `pop` to obtain only the sampled rows listed in `samp`. We do this using **square bracket notation** `dataset[row number, column number/name]. Run the following command to find your sampled words and sizes:


```r
pop[samp,]
```

```
    position size      word
136      136    2        to
112      112    6    cannot
181      181    4      have
205      205    5     these
131      131    3       far
85        85    5     their
13        13    9 continent
208      208    2        we
100      100    6    should
178      178    3       who
```

c. Compute your sample mean

The word lengths in part (b) are the data for your sample. You can compute your sample mean using a calculator, or using R. Let's try R (you will find it faster!). First save the quantitative variable `size` in a new variable called `mysize`:


```r
mysize <- pop[samp, "size"]
mysize
```

```
 [1] 2 6 4 5 3 5 9 2 6 3
```

Then find the mean of these values:


```r
mean(mysize)
```

```
[1] 4.5
```

How does this sample mean (from a truly random sample) compare to your sample mean from the non-random sample?

*Answer:*  The true mean is  4.29. Your two means will likely vary. Since the many non-random samples generally overestimated the population mean length, it is possible (but not guaranteed) that *your* one non-random sample gave a mean length that is greater than the random sample's mean length.
