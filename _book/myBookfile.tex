\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction to Statistics}

Welcome to the captivating world of statistics! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you'll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in data analysis, statistical inference, and randomness. Some of the areas we'll delve into include linear regression, experimental design, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and the bootstrap method.

Although statistics is a field that relies on mathematics, it stands apart as a distinct discipline. At the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you'll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it's crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learn basic principles of data analysis, and how data is produced and used in studies and experiments.
\item
  Understand role of variation and randomness. Understand principles of inference: confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
\item
  Develop ability to examine statistical arguments critically.
\item
  Learn how to use software (R/RStudio) to analyze data, create graphs, perform basic statistical tests
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-is-r}{%
\chapter{What is R?}\label{what-is-r}}

R is a free and open source statistical programming language that facilitates statistical computation. There are a myriad of application that can be done in R, thanks to a huge online support community and dedicated packages. However, R has no graphical user interface and it has to be run by typing commands into a text interface.

\hypertarget{what-is-rstudio}{%
\section{What is RStudio?}\label{what-is-rstudio}}

RStudio provides graphical interface to R! You can think of RStudio as a graphical front-end to R that that provides extra functionality. The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an essential component of this course.

\hypertarget{r-studio-server}{%
\section{R Studio Server}\label{r-studio-server}}

The quickest way to get started is to go to \url{https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu}, which opens an R Studio window in your web browser. Once logged in, I recommend that you do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Step 1: Create a folder for this course where you can save all of your work. In the Files window, click on New Folder.
\item
  Step 2: Click on Tools -\textgreater{} Global Options -\textgreater{} R Markdown. Then uncheck the box that says ``Show output inline\ldots{}''
\end{itemize}

(It is also possible to download RStudio on your own laptop. Instructions may be found at the end of this document.)

\hypertarget{rrstudio}{%
\section{R/RStudio}\label{rrstudio}}

The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an
essential component of this course. You have two options for using
RStudio:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{server version} of RStudio on the web at
  (\url{https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu}). The advantage of using the
  server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud,
  where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you
  can access your work from any computer on campus using a web
  browser. This server may run slow during peak days/hours. I also recommend
  you to download a local version of R server in your computer in case of rare outages.
\item
  A \textbf{local version} of RStudio installed on your machine. This
  option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this
  course demands. Using this version you can only store your files in your local machine. Additionally, we can save our work on GitHub. We will learn how to use GitHub in the beginning of the course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source. Please make sure that you have recently updated both R and RStudio.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{installing-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}}{Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}}\label{installing-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}}

\begin{quote}
Download the latest version of R: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Download the free Rstudio desktop version: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}
\end{quote}

Use the default download and install options for each. For R, download the ``precompiled binary'' distribution rather than the source code

\textbf{Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}

If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To check your version of R, run the command \texttt{getRversion()} and compare your version to the newest version posted on \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.
\item
  In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option \texttt{Help\ \textgreater{}\ Check\ for\ updates}. Follow directions if an update is needed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update)}

Do whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch
RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png}{here},
but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code
or made any figures yet!

Put your cursor in the pane labeled \emph{Console}, which is where you
interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
like \texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ 2\ *\ 4} (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the
\texttt{x} object by typing \texttt{x} followed by enter or return. You should see
the value \texttt{8} printed. If this happened, you've succeeded in
installing R and RStudio!

\hypertarget{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}{%
\section{Install LaTeX (for knitting R Markdown documents to PDF):}\label{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}}

You need a Latex compiler to create a pdf document from a R Markdown file. If you use the maize server, you don't need to install anything. If you are using a local RStudio, you should install a Latex compiler. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.tug.org/mactex/}{MacTeX} for Mac (3.2GB)
\item
  \href{https://miktex.org/download}{MiKTeX} for Windows (190MB)
\item
  Alternatively, you can install the \texttt{tinytex} R package by running
  \texttt{install.packages("tinytex")} in the console.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize2-server}{%
\section{Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize2 server)}\label{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize2-server}}

If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To check your version of R, run the command \texttt{getRversion()} and compare your version to the newest version posted on \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.
\item
  In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option \texttt{Help\ \textgreater{}\ Check\ for\ updates}. Follow directions if an update is needed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{opening-a-new-file}{%
\section{Opening a new file}\label{opening-a-new-file}}

If using Rstudio on your computer, using the \textbf{File\textgreater Open File} menu to find and open this .Rmd file.

If using Maize Rstudio from your browser:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the Files tab, select \textbf{Upload} and \textbf{Choose File} to find the .Rmd that you downloaded. Click \emph{OK} to upload to your course folder/location in the maize server account.
\item
  Click on the .Rmd file in the appropriate folder to open the file.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{running-codes-and-knitting-.rmd-files}{%
\section{Running codes and knitting .Rmd files:}\label{running-codes-and-knitting-.rmd-files}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You can run a line of code by placing your cursor in the line of code and clicking \textbf{Run Selected Line(s)}
\item
  You can run an entire chunk by clicking the green triangle on the right side of the code chunk.
\item
  After each small edit or code addition, \textbf{Knit} your Markdown. If you wait until the end to Knit, it will be harder to find errors in your work.
\item
  Format output type: You can use any of pdf\_document, html\_document type, or word\_document type.
\item
  \textbf{Maize users}: You may also need to allow for ``pop-up'' in your web browser when knitting documents.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{few-more-instructions}{%
\section{Few More Instructions}\label{few-more-instructions}}

The default setting in Rstudio when you are running chunks is that the ``output'' (numbers, graphs) are
shown \textbf{inline} within the Markdown Rmd. If you prefer to have your plots appear on the right of the console and not below the chunk, then change the settings as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select Tools \textgreater{} Global Options.
\item
  Click the R Markdown section and uncheck (if needed) the option Show output inline for all
  R Markdown documents.
\item
  Click OK.
\end{enumerate}

Now try running R chunks in the .Rmd file to see the difference. You can recheck this box if you prefer
the default setting.

\hypertarget{vpn}{%
\section{VPN}\label{vpn}}

If you plan to do any work off campus this term, you need to install Carleton's VPN. This will allow you to access the \textbf{maize} server (if needed).

\textbf{Installing the GlobalProtect VPN}

Follow the directions \href{https://wiki.carleton.edu/display/itskb/GlobalProtect+VPN}{here} to install VPN.

\hypertarget{r-markdown-basics}{%
\chapter{R Markdown Basics}\label{r-markdown-basics}}

An R Markdown file (.Rmd file) combines R commands and written analyses, which are `knit' together into an HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word document.

An R Markdown file contains three essential elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Header: The header (top) of the file contains information like the document title, author, date and your preferred output format (pdf\_document, word\_document, or html\_document).
\item
  Written analysis: You write up your analysis after the header and embed R code where needed. The online help below shows ways to add formatting details like bold words, lists, section labels, etc to your final pdf/word/html document. For example, adding ** before and after a word will bold that word in your compiled document.
\item
  R chunks: R chunks contain the R commands that you want evaluated. You embed these chunks within your written analysis and they are evaluated when you compile the document.
\end{itemize}

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

\hypertarget{r-markdown-syntax}{%
\section{R Markdown Syntax}\label{r-markdown-syntax}}

\hypertarget{lists-in-r-markdown}{%
\subsection{Lists in R Markdown:}\label{lists-in-r-markdown}}

You can use asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as \texttt{*italics*\ or\ **bold**}. You can create lists with a dash:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{2}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{3}
  \SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ Subitem }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

to produce

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Item 1
\item
  Item 2
\item
  Item 3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Subitem 1
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Item 4
\end{itemize}

You can embed Latex equations in-line, \texttt{\$\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\}\ \textbackslash{}sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}\{n\}\ x\_\{i\}\$} to produce \(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\) or in a new line as \texttt{\$\$\textbackslash{}text\{Var\}(X)\ =\ \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n-1\}\textbackslash{}sum\_\{i-1\}\^{}\{n\}\ (x\_\{i\}\ -\ \textbackslash{}bar\{x\})\^{}2\$\$} to produce \[\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i-1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2\]

\hypertarget{embed-an-r-code-chunk}{%
\subsection{Embed an R code chunk:}\label{embed-an-r-code-chunk}}

Use the following

  You \textbf{can} discuss homework problems with classmates, but you must write up \textbf{your own} homework solutions and \textbf{do your own work in R (no sharing commands or output) unless explicitly told otherwise}.
\item
  \textbf{Getting help}: You \textbf{can} use the following resources to complete your homework:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Carleton faculty (myself, other stat faculty, etc)
  \item
    Discussions with classmates (see above) or knowledgeable friends
  \item
    The math skills center
  \item
    Lab assistants (in CMC 304)
  \item
    Prefects
  \item
    Student solutions provided in the back of your student textbook or in the student solution manual
  \item
    It is okay to get coding help from prefects, tutors, classmates, online resources, but extra care should be done to write your own versions of the codes.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  You \textbf{cannot} use any resources other than the ones listed above to complete assignments (homework, reports, etc) for this class. E.g. you cannot use a friend's old assignments or reports, answers found on the internet, textbook (instructor) solutions manual, etc.
\end{itemize}

  \item
    Homework number (e.g., ``homework 1'')
  \item
    Your name
  \item
    The names of classmates that you worked with on all or part of the assignment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Turn in a neat, \textbf{correctly ordered}, and \textbf{legible} assignment with no ragged edges. If it can't be read, it will not be graded.
\item
  \textbf{Staple} - no folded corners accepted!

In this worksheet, we will explore various options for outputting and formatting tables in R using the RMarkdown environment.

\hypertarget{basic-table-formatting-with-kable}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Basic Table Formatting with \texttt{kable}}{Basic Table Formatting with kable}}\label{basic-table-formatting-with-kable}}

The \texttt{kable()} function from the knitr package provides a simple way to output tables in RMarkdown.

\subsection{Hiding R commands and R output}\label{hiding-r-commands-and-r-output}}

As mentioned in the graph formatting handout, adding the chunk option echo=FALSE will display output (like graphs) produced by a chunk but not show the commands used in the chunk. You can stop both R commands and output from being displayed in a document by adding the chunk option include=FALSE.

As you work through a report analysis, you may initially want to see all of your R results as you are writing your report. But after you've summarized results in paragraphs or in tables, you can then use the include=FALSE argument to hide your R commands and output in your final document. If you ever need to rerun or reevaluate your R work for a report, you can easily recreate and edit your analysis since the R chunks used in your original report are still in your R Markdown .Rmd file.

\hypertarget{report-guidelines}{%
\chapter{Report Guidelines}\label{report-guidelines}}

The data analysis report that you will be writing for this class will ask two things of you:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  use appropriate statistical methods to answer research questions and
\item
  clearly and concisely communicate the meaning of your statistics and graphs to a \textbf{reader} who has a basic knowledge of statistics.
\end{enumerate}

Your report should be organized, well-written with proper use of grammar, and contain sound reasoning and correct interpretations of statistical evidence. Also include \emph{at least one} graphical display of your data on the body of your report. Be sure to hide the code used to produce it!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Your lab reports should be organized into the following sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Introduction:} describe the data and your research questions
  \item
    \textbf{Results:} describe your statistical analysis and interpret your graphs and numbers
  \item
    \textbf{Discussion:} summarize your findings and answer your research questions, describe any limitations of
    your analysis
  \item
    \textbf{Technical Appendix:} Staple all relevant R commands and output to the end of your written report. Only including commands without output is not enough. You must appropriately comment your code (telling me what each section of code is doing), and edit your code and output (no typos or errors allowed).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type your report in Word/Google doc (or similar software) and use R (not Excel, Statkey or other software) for your analysis. You can also use R Markdown to write up your reports but you need to take care to only include labeled and numbered graphical output from R in the main document. Commands and numerical output should be placed in the Technical Appendix. If you are interested in using Markdown talk to me for hints on its use for reports.
\item
  Carefully decide \textbf{appropriate graphs and numbers} to include. There is no need to show the same data in different forms (e.g.~no need to show both a histogram and boxplot for the same variable). You also don't need to include all numbers given in R output if you only use a few in your analysis. You also don't need to ``show'' (or prove) skewness or outliers using numbers, just use your graphs to display skewness or outliers.
\item
  \textbf{Interpret} and give meaning to \textbf{all} graphs and numbers that you choose to include in your report. Do not include algebraic calculations or too much technical detail.
\item
  \textbf{Including Numbers:} \textbf{Never include R numerical output or commands}. Summarize needed output in a nicely formatted Word table or just integrate numbers into your writing. In you include tables, label them numerically (Table 1, Table 2, etc) and give each a title. Number in order of how they appear in the paper and refer to these tables by their number (``Table 1 displays summary statistics for income.'').
\item
  \textbf{Including Graphs:} Resize all graphs appropriately so they fit nicely into your written report. Large graphs that take up most of a page with no, or very little, writing on the page impede the flow of the report and reduce its readability. Label all graphs numerically (Figure 1, etc.) as they occur in the paper, give each a title and refer to by number. See the stats lab manual chapter 1 if you need help copying plots into a Word/google doc.
\item
  \textbf{Do not explain every step taken in your study.} For example, there is no need to include a statement such as ``I used R to create a histogram of income and observed that the distribution was right skewed''. Instead just say ``The distribution of income is skewed to the right (Figure 1)``.
\item
  Avoid using weak phrases like ``The average height of men is higher than the average for women.'' \textbf{Use numbers to bolster your explanation:} ``The average height of men is three inches more than the average for women (68.5 vs.~65.5 inches).''
\item
  The \textbf{precision} of your data should dictate the precision of your statistics. In general, your statistics can have one to two more significant digits than your data. For example, if height is recorded to the nearest inch then the mean height should be reported as 65.5 (or 65.49) rather than the R value of 65.49268.
\item
  Sometimes a question posed in a study is \textbf{ambiguous} and there may be more than one way to correctly answer to the question. In grading your reports and paper, \textbf{I am most concerned with the logic of your conclusions and how you support your claim using data and statistical evidence.}

\emph{Answer:}

This study aimed to measure the effects of psychological biases on estimates of compliance with public health guidance regarding COVID-19. Results showed that compliance estimates were reduced when questions were framed negatively and anonymity was increased. Effect sizes were large, with compliance estimates diminishing by up to 17\% points and 10\% points, respectively. These findings suggest that standard tracking surveys pose questions in ways that lead to higher compliance estimates than alternative approaches.

\hypertarget{gettysburg-random-sample}{%
\subsection{Gettysburg random sample}\label{gettysburg-random-sample}}

Let's take a simple random sample (SRS) of Gettysburg words. The ``population'' is contained in the
spreadsheet \texttt{GettysburgPopulationCounts.csv}. Carefully load this data into R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pop }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/GettysbergPopulationCounts.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  position size  word
1        1    4  Four
2        2    5 score
3        3    3   and
4        4    5 seven
5        5    5 years
6        6    3  ago,
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{position} variable enumerates the list of words in the population (address).

(a). Sample

Run the following command to obtain a SRS of 10 words from the 268 that are in the population:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{samp }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{sample}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{268}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{size=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{samp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] 259 238 248  68 208 114 185 100 135 206
\end{verbatim}

This tells you the position (row number) of your sampled words. What are your sampled positions? Why are your sampled positions different from other folks in class?

(b). Get words and lengths

We will \emph{subset} the data set \texttt{pop} to obtain only the sampled rows listed in \texttt{samp}. We do this using \textbf{square bracket notation} `dataset{[}row number, column number/name{]}. Run the following command to find your sampled words and sizes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pop[samp,]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
    position size    word

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute your sample mean
\end{enumerate}

The word lengths in part (b) are the data for your sample. You can compute your sample mean using a calculator, or using R. Let's try R (you will find it faster!). First save the quantitative variable \texttt{size} in a new variable called \texttt{mysize}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mysize }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ pop[samp, }\StringTok{"size"}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{mysize}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] 6 4 5 2 2 2 5 6 5 7
\end{verbatim}

Then find the mean of these values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(mysize)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 4.4
\end{verbatim}

How does this sample mean (from a truly random sample) compare to your sample mean from the non-random sample?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The true mean is 4.29. Your two means will likely vary. Since the many non-random samples generally overestimated the population mean length, it is possible (but not guaranteed) that \emph{your} one non-random sample gave a mean length that is greater than the random sample's mean length.

\emph{Answer:} No you can't make this conclusion from the info given. In fact, an online poll at a website like \texttt{cnn.com} is almost always reporting results from a non-random sample. The people who respond are individuals who visit \texttt{cnn.com}, then see the online poll and decide to respond.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} This is a volunteer sample, and volunteer samples are often biased and can't be generalized to \emph{all drivers} (the population). It is likely that people who have driven with a pet on their lap are more likely to respond to the poll.

Consider the following case study:

``Swimming with dolphins can certainly be fun, but is it also therapeutic for patients suffering from clinical depression? To investigate this possibility, researchers recruited 30 subjects aged 18-65 with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate depression. Subjects were required to discontinue use of any antidepressant drugs or psychotherapy four weeks prior to the experiment, and throughout the experiment. These 30 subjects went to an island off the coast of Honduras, where they were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Both groups engaged in the same amount of swimming and snorkeling each day, but one group (the animal care program) did so in the presence of bottlenose dolphins and the other group (outdoor nature program) did not. At the end of two weeks, each subjects' level of depression was evaluated, as it had been at the beginning of the study, and it was determined whether they showed substantial improvement (reducing their level of depression) by the end of the study (Antonioli and Reveley, 2005).''

Observed data:

The researchers found that 10 of 15 subjects in the dolphin therapy group showed substantial improvement, compared to 3 of 15 subjects in the control group.

Consider the following case study:

``Researchers want to find out how a new diet affects weight gain among underweight subjects. This experiment only has two treatment conditions, the new diet and the standard diet. For this study, the researchers recruited 200 subjects which will be grouped into 100 pairs based on shared characteristics such as age, gender, weight, height, lifestyle, and so on. A 20-year-old female within the weight range of 90-110 pounds and the height range of 60-63 inches will be paired with another 20-year-old female that falls into the same weight and height categories. Once all 100 pairs are made, a subject from each pair will be randomly assigned into the treatment group (will be administered the new diet for 2 months) while the other subject from the pair will be assigned to the control group (will be assigned to follow the standard diet for two months). At the end of the time time period of 2 months, researchers will measure the total weight gain for each subject.''

Then, we use \texttt{ggplot2} to create a bar plot with the categories on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. The column names of \texttt{count\_data} are automatically assigned to be \texttt{Var1} and \texttt{Freq}. We can change the column names to \texttt{category} and \texttt{count}, for example, as:

\emph{answer:} 859

(e). Conditional proportions: state strike status by juror race

The \texttt{prop.table} command gives conditional proportions for a two-way table. We plug our two-way table into \texttt{prop.table} with a \texttt{margin=1} to get proportions grouped by the \textbf{row} variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{prop.table}\NormalTok{(mytable, }\AttributeTok{margin =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}

  White           0.8747454       0.1252546
\end{verbatim}

Of all eligible black jurors, about 57.9\% were struck by the state.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What proportion of eligible white jurors were struck by the state?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{answer:} about 12.5\%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is there evidence of an association between juror race and state strikes?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{answer:} Yes, there is an association because the rate of state strikes varies greatly by juror race with
about 60\% of black jurors were struck compared to only 13\% of white jurors

(f). Stacked bar graph for two variables

We can visualize the conditional distribution from part (e) with a stacked bar graph created using the \texttt{ggplot2} graphing package. First, load this package's functions with the \texttt{library} command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we can use the \texttt{geom\_bar} command in this package. Here we get the conditional distribution of \texttt{struck\_state} given \texttt{race}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(jurors, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ race, }\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ struck\_state)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_bar}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{position =} \StringTok{"fill"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"State strikes by juror race"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"proportion"}\NormalTok{, }
       \AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"eligible juror race"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"struck by state?"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Class_Activity_4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1}

The basic syntax for this function is to let \texttt{ggplot} know your data set name (\texttt{jurors}), then specify the grouping or conditional variable on the x-axis (\texttt{race}) in the \texttt{aes} (aesthetic) argument. The \texttt{fill} variable is the response variable (\texttt{struck\_state}). We add (\texttt{+}) the \texttt{geom\_bar} geometry to get a bar graph with the \texttt{fill} position specified. Adding an informative label and title complete the graph.

(g). Conditional distribution of race grouped by strike status

We can ``flip'' our response and grouping variables easily (if we think it makes sense to do so). Here we specify the \texttt{margin=2} to get proportions grouped by the \textbf{column} variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{prop.table}\NormalTok{(mytable, }\AttributeTok{margin =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Graduate programs acceptance and sex}\label{graduate-programs-acceptance-and-sex}}

How are grad school program acceptance rates associated with sex? We will look at a classic data set from Berkeley grad school applications from 1973 (\emph{Science}, 1975). The data cases are applicants to four graduate programs at Berkeley during 1973. The variable \texttt{result} tells us if the applicant was accepted to the graduate program, \texttt{sex} tells us the sex of the applicant (male or female), and \texttt{program} tells us program type (programs 1,2,3 or 4).

\emph{Answer:} About 43\% (1284/3014) of applicants were accepted.

(b). Two-way tables

The \texttt{table} command also gives two-way tables when two variables are included. Here is the two-way table for result and sex:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{table}\NormalTok{(grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{sex, grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{result)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How many applicants involved females who were accepted?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} : 262 applicants involved females who were accepted.

(c). Conditional proportions: acceptance given sex

The \texttt{prop.table} command gives conditional proportions for a two-way table. First let's save the two-way table in an object named \texttt{mytable}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mytable }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{table}\NormalTok{(grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{sex, grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{result)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then use \texttt{prop.table} to get the distribution of result conditioned (grouped) on applicant's sex:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{prop.table}\NormalTok{(mytable, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
        
            accept    reject
  female 0.3085984 0.6914016
  male   0.4720554 0.5279446
\end{verbatim}

The value of \texttt{1} in this command tell's R that you want \emph{row} proportions (the denominator of the proportion is each row total).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What proportion of female were accepted?
\end{itemize}

\emph{Answer:} about 31\% (262/(262+587))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What proportion of males were accepted?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} about 47\% (1022/(1022+1143))

(d). Bar graph for one variable

We can create a data frame \texttt{count\_data1} containing the counts and their corresponding categories.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{counts1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{table}\NormalTok{(grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{result)}
\NormalTok{count\_data1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(counts1)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then, we use \texttt{ggplot2} to create a bar plot with the categories on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. The column names of \texttt{count\_data} are automatically assigned to be \texttt{Var1} and \texttt{Freq}. We can change the column names to \texttt{category} and \texttt{count}, for example, as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{colnames}\NormalTok{(count\_data1) }\OtherTok{=} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"category"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"count"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{count\_data1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  category count
1   accept  1284
2   reject  1730
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{geom\_bar(stat\ =\ "identity")} function is used to create the bars, and we set the y-axis label using \texttt{labs()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Create a bar plot using ggplot2}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)  }\CommentTok{\# load the package}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(count\_data1, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ category, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ count)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_bar}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"count"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Class_Activity_4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-27-1}

(e). Stacked bar graph for two variables

Now we can use the \texttt{geom\_bar} command in this package. Here we get the conditional distribution of \texttt{result} given \texttt{sex}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2) }\CommentTok{\# don\textquotesingle{}t need if you already entered it for example 1}
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(grad, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ sex, }\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ result)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_bar}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{position =} \StringTok{"fill"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{y=}\StringTok{"Proportion"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{title =} \StringTok{"result by sex"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"result?"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"sex"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Class_Activity_4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-28-1}

The basic syntax for this function is to let \texttt{ggplot} know your data set name (\texttt{grad}), then specify the grouping or conditional variable on the x-axis (\texttt{sex}) in the \texttt{aes} (aesthetic) argument. The \texttt{fill} variable is the response variable (\texttt{result}). We add (\texttt{+}) the \texttt{geom\_bar} geometry to get a bar graph with the \texttt{fill} position specified. Adding an informative label and title complete the graph.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Verify that this graph is plotting the conditional proportions from part (c)
\end{itemize}

(f). Subsetting by program type

Finally, we will repeat the previous analysis of result and sex, but this time we will divide (or subset) the data set by program type. To do this we need to know how the values of \texttt{program} are coded:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{table}\NormalTok{(grad}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{program)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

program1 program2 program3 program4 
     933      585      782      714 
\end{verbatim}

Here we use the \texttt{filter} command available from the \texttt{dplyr} package to get only the applicants to program 1:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\NormalTok{grad.p1 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(grad, program }\SpecialCharTok{==} \StringTok{"program1"}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# gets rows where program equal program1}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(grad.p1)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Verify that the number of rows in the subsetted program 1 data set matches the number of program 1 applicants shown in the \texttt{table} of counts above.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Repeat the \texttt{filter} command to get a data set for program 2 and call the new data set \texttt{grad.p2}. Verify that the number of rows in this dataset matches the number of program 2 applicants in the original data set.

\emph{Answer:} For both programs 1 and 2, we see that female applicants have a slightly higher rate of acceptance
than male applicants. After accounting for program type, we now see that black defendants have a higher
rate of death penalty than white defendants. Without accounting for program type, the opposite was true
(see parts (c) and (e)).

Why? the confounding affect of program type which is associated with both result and sex:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  females prefer to apply to programs 3 and 4 while males prefer programs 1 and 2 (more than 3 and

-Programs 3 and 4 were much harder to get into than programs 1 and 2
- 64\% of applicants to program 1 were accepted and 63\% of applicants to program 2 were accepted

\end{verbatim}

So since the majority of females applied to the toughest programs (as measured by acceptance rates),
there overall rate of acceptance was lower for females compared to males. But when we break down
these rates by program type, we see that females have higher acceptance rates than males (see the
visual in part (i)).

(i). A bar graph with three variables

If we simply want to graph the relationship between result and sex for each type of program, we can avoid subsetting the data by using the \texttt{facet\_wrap} command in \texttt{ggplot2}. It is one simple addition to the stacked bar graph in part (e):

distribution). So two standard deviations is about 2 hours of sleep, making one standard deviation about

\emph{Answer:} The intercept is -0.0127. A student who drinks 0 beers would be predicted to have a negative blood alcohol content. This is not possible so the intercept does not make sense in this context, but the intercept is included in the model to get the best fit line for the data collected.

\textbf{Interpret:} There is one case of 9 beers with a large residual (much higher BAC than predicted), but since there is no clear pattern (trend) in this plot it looks like our regression model adequately describes the relationship between number of beers and BAC.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the magnitude of the scatter around the horizontal 0-line in the residuals plot greater than, less than, or the same as the magnitude of the scatter around the regression line in the scatterplot?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The same! The residuals plot is only a ``detrended'' scatterplot, meaning the vertical distances between a point and the regression line on the scatterplot or a point and the 0-line on the residuals plot are exactly the same. The residual plot looks more scattered because the trend is removed and the scale of the y-axis compressed.

  What is the regression line for females? for males?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} For females: \(\widehat{BAC} = -0.016 +0.021(BAC)\) and for males: \(\widehat{BAC} = -0.01 +0.015(BAC)\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which gender has the largest slope? What does this suggest about the relationship between number of beers and BAC for this gender?
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The slope for females is slightly higher. This shows that the effect of one more beer on predicted BAC in females is larger than males (a 0.021 increase vs.~a 0.015 increase).

Another way to obtain regression models by \texttt{Gender} is to split the data set in a female and male data set, then run your \texttt{lm} on these two data sets. The benefit of this method is you can then create a residuals plot for your model much easier than the quicker method above:

\emph{Question:} What does each dot represent?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} One sample mean from the bootstrapped sample.

\emph{Question:} What is the shape of your sampling distribution?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} Roughly symmetric.

\emph{Question:} Where is your distribution centered?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} About 20.5

\emph{Question:} The distribution should be centered at the original sample mean. Verify it. Do we know the population mean? If not, what does it tell us about the center of this distribution.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} It is close to the original sample mean. We do not know the population mean, so the bootstrap distribution will carry the bias of the original sample mean.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} About 1.25, it looks like most of the bootstrapped sample means are between 18 to 23 so 2 standard deviations is about 2.5. This makes the SD about 1.25.

\emph{Question:} The standard deviation of sampling distribution has a separate name. It is called the \textbf{Standard Error}. Verify the standard deviation of this distribution using R-code.

\emph{Answer:} The bootstrap sample was obtained by resampling from the 500 observed commute distances with
replacement. Basically we randomly select 500 distances from the data (with replacement).

The value of the bootstrap mean will vary.

(c). Use the margin of error to give a confidence interval for the population parameter and interpret this interval in context.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} \(0.60 \pm .03\) gives an interval from 0.57 to 0.63
I am 95\% confident that the proportion of American adults who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate is between 57\% and 63\%.

(d). Is it reasonable to say that a majority of American adults would vote for a qualified presidential candidate? (Is 0.50 a plausible value?)

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The proportion of all Americans who would vote for a Muslim presidential candidate is likely between 57\% and 63\%, so we could say that majority (\textgreater50\%) would vote for a Muslim candidate.

(e). Explain what ``95\% confidence'' mean for this example. (Don't just repeat your answer to 1c.)

A similar random sample in 2015 found the rate of female gun ownership rose to 12\%. Though not given in the article, let's assume that the SE for the difference in these two sample proportions is 2\%.

(c). Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the parameter in a.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} \((0.09 - 0.12) \pm (.02) = -0.03 \pm 0.04 = -0.07 \text{ to } 0.01, or -7\% \text{ to } 1\%\)

(d). Interpret your interval in c and explain why this support the authors claim that ``the increase {[}in female gun ownership{]} was not meaningful.''

\emph{Answer:} We are 95\% confident that the female gun owner rate in 1994 could be 7 percentage point lower to 1 percentage point higher than the rate in 2015. We can say that the observed increase from 1994 to 2015 of 3\% is not ``statistically significant'' because it is within the margin of error (4\%) for this study.

In a study, 30 participants were randomly assigned to engage in either aerobic exercise or resistance training (15 in each group). Their resting heart rate was measured before and after a 6-week exercise program. We want to test if there is a difference in the mean decrease in resting heart rate between aerobic exercise and resistance training. The hypotheses are:

\[H_0: \mu_A-\mu_R=0 \quad\quad H_A: \mu_A-\mu_R \neq 0\]

\emph{Answer:} To generate a randomization distribution for the sample mean difference, we would randomly reassign the treatment (aerobic exercise or resistance training) to the study participants.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} We can use the \texttt{permTest} function from the \texttt{CarletonStats} package to generate a randomization distribution for the difference in means and calculate the p-value for the two-tailed test. We can compare the p-value of \(2e^{-4}\) to a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) to determine if the observed difference of 6.2 bpm is statistically significant. Since the p-value is less than the significance level, the observed difference is statistically significant.

\emph{Answer:} Since the p-value is less than the significance level, it means that the observed difference of 6.2 bpm is highly unlikely to occur just by random chance under the null hypothesis. In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean decrease in resting heart rate between aerobic exercise and resistance training.

A study investigated the success rate of job applicants who used a career coaching service (CCS) compared to those who didn't (NCCS). Out of 120 applicants, 60 used the CCS and 60 did not. We want to test if there is a difference in the proportion of successful applicants between CCS and NCCS groups. out of the 60 applicants who used the career coaching service (CCS), 42 were successful and 18 were unsuccessful. Out of the 60 applicants who did not use the career coaching service (NCCS), 30 were successful and 30 were unsuccessful. The hypotheses are:

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} Using \emph{Statkey} to generate a randomization distribution for the difference in proportions and observing the p-value for the two-tailed test, we can compare the p-value to a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) to determine if the observed difference of 0.20 is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than the significance level, the observed difference is statistically significant; otherwise, it is not. The p-value based on this randomization distribution under null hypothesis is \(2 \times 0.018 = 0.036\). So, the observed difference of 0.020 is statistically significant.

\subsection{(a) Type I Error}\label{a-type-i-error}}

Explain what a Type I error is in the context of this example, and describe the consequences of making such an error.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. In this context, it means that we conclude the new teaching method is more effective than the traditional method when, in reality, there is no difference. The consequences of making a Type I error could include investing time and resources into a new teaching method that isn't actually more effective, leading to inefficient allocation of resources.

\emph{Answer:} A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false. In this context, it means that we conclude that there is no difference between the new teaching method and the traditional method when, in reality, the new method is more effective. The consequences of making a Type II error could include missing out on the opportunity to improve students' learning outcomes by not adopting the more effective teaching method.

If the school administration believes that making a Type I error is much worse than making a Type II error, what adjustments could be made to the significance level to account for this? Explain your reasoning.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} To decrease the chance of making a Type I error, the school administration could choose a smaller significance level, such as 0.01 instead of the typical 0.05. By using a smaller significance level, we require stronger evidence (smaller p-value) to reject the null hypothesis, thus reducing the probability of making a Type I error.

List the factors that influence the probability of making a Type II error and briefly describe how they affect the error rate in this context.

Click for answer

Answer: Factors that influence the probability of making a Type II error include:

\emph{Effect size:} The true difference between the new teaching method and the traditional method. A larger effect size makes it easier to detect a difference, reducing the Type II error rate.

\emph{Sample size:} The number of students involved in the study. A larger sample size increases the power of the test, making it more likely to detect a true difference and reducing the Type II error rate.

\emph{Variability:} The amount of variation in the students' learning outcomes. Higher variability makes it more difficult to detect a true difference, increasing the Type II error rate.

\emph{Significance level:} The chosen significance level (alpha) also affects the Type II error rate. A larger significance level (e.g., 0.10) decreases the Type II error rate but increases the Type I error rate.

\hypertarget{e-balancing-error-rates}{%
\subsection{(e) Balancing Error Rates}\label{e-balancing-error-rates}}

Discuss how the school administration could balance the Type I and Type II error rates when evaluating the effectiveness of the new teaching method. What factors should they consider?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} Balancing the Type I and Type II error rates involves considering the consequences of each type of error and the desired level of confidence in the results. The administration should weigh the risks and benefits of adopting a new teaching method versus maintaining the traditional method. They should also consider factors such as the cost and feasibility of implementing the new method, as well as the potential impact on student learning outcomes. Ultimately, the administration should choose a significance level and sample size that balance the risks associated with Type I and Type II errors while taking into account practical constraints and priorities.

\end{itemize}

\emph{Answer:} The very low case pulls down the mean response for boys (with: \(\bar{x}_{B5} = -0.10435\), without: \(\bar{x}_{B5} = 0.01417\)). Since the girl mean response doesn't change (\(\bar{x}_{G5} = 0.02906\)), omitting this case will make the \emph{two means closer together} which makes their difference closer to 0 (with: \(\bar{x}_{B5} - \bar{x}_{G5} = -0.13341\), without: \(\bar{x}_{B5} - \bar{x}_{G5} = -0.01488\)).

\item
  Do the SEs of the distributions (bootstrap and randomization) get smaller or larger with the case omitted? Explain why these change.
\end{itemize}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The very low case creates larger variability in the sample mean for boys, which in turn makes the SE for the sample mean difference more variable (with: SE about 0.26, without: SE about 0.24).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute the z-score for the observed difference in means using randomization distribution. Is this value futher or closer to a z-score of 0 with the case omitted? Explain why it changes.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The z-score is closer to 0 with the case removed (with: \(z = -0.51\), without: \(z = -0.061\))
\[
z = \dfrac{-0.01488  - 0}{0.24569} = -0.061
\]
The z-score is closer to 0 because the sample mean difference is closer to 0 with the case removed, and this change is greater than the relatively small decrease in SE that we noted with the case removed.

\emph{Answer:} The observed sample proportion is 0.67 with a standard error of 0.021. If the null is true, then we would expect the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be (approximately) normally distributed with a center of 0.50 and SE of 0.021. The standardized score for the sample proportion is then
\[
z = \dfrac{\textrm{statistic} - \textrm{null parameter}}{SE} = \dfrac{0.67 - 0.50}{0.021} = 8.10
\]
The observed proportion is 8.1 SEs above the hypothesized value of 0.5.

\emph{Answer:} The p-value is larger than a 5\% significance level, so we do not find evidence of a difference between men and women in the proportion that view divorce as morally acceptable. About 17\% of the time we would observe a difference in male/female views of 4 percentage points or greater just by chance.

\section{Example 1: Movie Goers are More Likely to Watch at Home}\label{example-1-movie-goers-are-more-likely-to-watch-at-home}}

In a random sample of 500 movie goers in January 2013, 320 of them said they are more likely to wait and watch a new movie in the comfort of their own home. Compute and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of movie goers who are more likely to watch a new movie from home.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} We see that \(\hat{p}=\frac{320}{500}=0.640\) (keep at least 3 decimal spots to ensure accuracy in your SE calculation!) The confidence interval is given by:

\[\text { Statistic }\pm z^{*} S E\]

\[\begin{array}{l}
\hat{p} \pm z^{*} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \\
0.64 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.64(1-0.64)}{500}} \\
0.64 \pm 0.042\\
(0.598, 0.682)
\end{array}\]

(Make sure to use proportions in your CI, then convert to \% at the end if you prefer a percentage interpretation.) We are 95\% sure that the proportion of all movie goers who are more likely to wait and watch a new movie at home is between 0.598 and 0.682.

\section{Example 3: Mendel's green peas?}\label{example-3-mendels-green-peas}}

One of Gregor Mendel's famous genetic experiments dealt with raising pea plants. According to Mendel's genetic theory, under a certain set of conditions the proportion of pea plants that produce smooth green peas should be p=3/16 (0.1875). A sample of n=556 plants from the experiment had 108 with smooth green peas. Does this provide evidence of a problem with Mendel's theory and that the proportion is different from 3/16? Show all details of the test.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} We are testing \(H_{0}: p=0.1875\) vs \(H_{a}: p \neq 0.1875\) where p represents the proportion of pea plans with smooth green peas. The sample proportion is \(\hat{p}=\frac{108}{556}=0.1942\) and the sample size is \(n=556\). The test statistic is:

\[z=\frac{\text { Statistic }-\text { Null }}{S E}=\frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0}\left(1-p_{0}\right)}{n}}}=\frac{0.1942-0.1875}{\sqrt{\frac{0.1875(1-0.1875)}{556}}}=0.405\]

This is a two-tail test, and we see that the area to the right of 0.405 in a normal distribution is 0.343 \texttt{(1-pnorm(0.405))}, so the p-value is 2(0.343) = 0.686.The R command is: \texttt{2*(1-pnorm(0.405))}

We do not reject H0 and conclude that this sample does not provide evidence that the proportion of smooth green pea plants is different from the 3/16 that Mendel's theory predicts. (It is worth pointing out that this does not ``prove'' Mendel's theory, since we don't ``accept'' \(H_0\)-- we just find a lack of sufficient evidence to refute it. )

A 2016 study described in The Guardian found that a random sample of US adults in 1994 found a female rate of gun ownership of 9\%. A similar random sample in 2015 found the rate of female gun ownership rose to 12\%. In the section 3.2 handout, we assumed that the SE for the difference in these two sample proportions is 2\%. Show how this SE was computed using the appropriate SE formula from chapter 6. Assume that the sample sizes in both 1994 and 2015 were 500.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:}
We have a 1994 sample proportion of \(\hat{p}_{1994} = 0.09\) and a 2015 sample proportion of \(\hat{p}_{2015} = 0.12\) . The SE of the difference in two sample proportions for a confidence interval is given by:

\[SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{1994} (1 - \hat{p}_{1994} )}{n_{1994}} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2015} (1 - \hat{p}_{2015} )}{n_{2015}}} = 0.0194 \approx 0.02 \]

\emph{Answer:}

We are testing \(H_0:p_L = p_N\) vs \(H_a:p_L \neq p_N\). The test statistic is

\[z = \frac{statistic-null}{SE} = \frac{(\hat{p}_L - \hat{p}_N) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_l} + \frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_N}}} = \frac{0.6458 - 0.5625}{\sqrt{\frac{0.6042(1-0.6042)}{48}} + \frac{0.6042*(1-0.6042)}{48}} = 0.834 \]

This is a two-tail test, and the area to the right of 0.834 in a normal distribution is 0.202 (1-pnorm(0.834)), so the p-value is 2(0.202) = 0.404. The R command is: 2*(1-pnorm(0.834))

The conditions are met for using the normal distribution (at least 10 values in each cell of the table). We see that the proportion of smokers who got pregnant is 38/135 = 0.281 while the proportion of non-smokers who got pregnant is 206/543 = 0.379. The confidence interval is given by:

\[statistic \pm z^* \cdot SE \]
\[(\hat{p}_S - \hat{p}_N) \pm z^* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_S(1- \hat{p}_S)}{n_S} + \frac{\hat{p}_N(1- \hat{p}_N)}{n_N}} \]

\[(0.281 - 0.379) \pm 1.645\cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.281(1-0.281)}{135} + \frac{0.379(1-0.379)}{543}} \]
\[-0.098 \pm 0.072 = (-0.170, -0.026) \]
We are 90\% sure that the proportion of smokers who get pregnant in the first cycle is between 0.170 and 0.026 less than the proportion of non-smokers who get pregnant on the first cycle. Note that if we had subtracted the other way, the interval would have only positive values, but the interpretation would be the same.

We have a SRS of 200 schools and are interested in how a school's performance is related to the wealth of its students.

\emph{Answer:} There are \(n_h = 102\) ``high'' wealth and \(n_l = 98\) ``low'' wealth schools. The low wealth schools tend to have higher (and more variable) growth than high wealth schools. The difference in observed mean API growth between high and low growth schools is \(\bar{x}_h - \bar{x}_l = 25.24510 - 38.82653 = -13.58\). We can use t-methods since both samples sizes (98 and 102) can be deemed large and there isn't severe skewness, but there are two extreme outliers that will be addressed below.

Suppose we omitted these two (most) extreme cases when running the test in (d). Will the p-value for this test be smaller or larger than the p-value computed in part (d)? Explain.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} Removing the two large outliers which will both reduce the mean in the high group and reduce the SD in the high group. Both actions will magnify the difference in mean growth between the high and low groups (increasing the difference and decreasing the SE), so the test stat will increase in magnitude and the p-value will decrease.

  Click for answer
\end{itemize}

\emph{Answer:} Without these outliers, the p-value decreases to 0.00001916 and we have even stronger evidence for a difference in mean API growth. Why does the p-value decrease? Omitting the two outliers will decrease the sample SD for the high group, which in turn will (slightly) decrease the SE for the difference in means. Omitting the two outliers will also decrease the sample mean for the high group (from 25.24510 to 22.56000), which will make the observed difference in means larger in magnitude (from -13.58 to -16.27). The test stat gets even further from 0 (drops from -3.2692 to -4.395), meaning the observed difference with outliers omitted is further away from 0 (in terms of SEs) than it was when all data points were included. This means that the p-value will decrease (from 0.0013 to 0.00002) since the data is deemed more ``extreme'' under the null hypothesis.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} Without outliers: -23.57 to -8.96 and with outliers: -21.77 to -5.39. An mentioned above, omitting the two points makes the difference in means further away from 0. This shifts the CI further from a difference of 0. Removing the outliers also decrease the SE of our sample difference, so the margin of error for the interval without outliers is, roughly, 7 while the margin of error with outliers is, roughly, 8.

\emph{Answer:} There is a moderate sample size of \(n=36\) so we need to assume that the observed differences (before-after) are not strongly skewed and that there are no outliers. If these assumptions are not met, then the t-inference procedures above may not be appropriate.

\emph{Answer:} Let the \(\mu\) represent the population mean decrease in glucose levels measured before and after the treatment (before - after). A positive value of \(\mu\) implies that the home meter is effective in reducing blood glucose levels. The alternative hypothesis (the research statement) will be that \(\mu\) is greater than 0 and the null statement will be that \(\mu\) is equal to 0, meaning there is no benefit to using the treatment.

\emph{Answer:} You reject \(H_0\) when the \(p\)-value is small. Since the P-value of 0.3\% is quite small, we can conclude that there is strong evidence that the use of home meters lowers blood glucose levels, on average (\(H_A\)).

\emph{Answer:} Since we rejected, we may have made a type 1 error of rejecting the null when it is actually true. This means we would have claimed that the home meter was useful in reducing blood glucose levels, on average, when in fact it doesn't reduce levels. People with diabetes would be encouraged to use these meters (at a cost to themselves or their insurance company) to help control their glucose levels and not see any real benefit.

\emph{Answer:} The 95\% CI for the population mean decrease in glucose level is
\[
\bar{x} \pm t^*_{n-1} \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 2.78\pm 2.042 \dfrac{6.05}{\sqrt{36}} = 2.78 \pm 2.017 = (0.72, 4.84)
\]
where \(t^*\) is based on 36-1=35 degrees of freedom. Using the green table, we round df down to 30 so we get \(t^*_{30} = 2.042\). Or using R command \texttt{qt(.975,df=35)} we get the exact value \(t^*_{35}=2.0301\).
We are 95\% confident that, after learning to use a home meter, the average decrease in blood glucose in this population is between 0.72 and 4.84 mmol/liter.

\section{Example 1: Food poisoning}\label{example-1-food-poisoning}}

Suppose in an outbreak, 447 of the 998 individuals who ate beef curry were observed to have food poisoning symptoms. As researchers, suppose we want to test the hypothesis that the probability (long run proportion) of a ``random individual who ate beef curry'' having food poisoning is 0.1. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:}The set of hypotheses are:

\(\mathrm{H}_0\) : \(p_{FP} = 0.1, \qquad p_{NFP} = 0.9\)
\(\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{a}} : \text{One proportion is different}\)

where \(p_{FP}\) is the proportion of people who had food poisoning and \(p_{NFP}\) is the proportion who did not have food poisoning. The expected count assuming the null hypothesis is true is \(n*p_{FP} = 998*0.1 = 99.8\) and \(n*p_{NFP} = 998*0.9 = 898.2\), respectively. The expected count is larger than 5, so we can proceed with the chi-square test. The observed count is 447 and 551 respectively. So, the test statistics can be constructed as

\begin{align*}
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E} = \frac{(447 - 99.8)^2}{99.8} +   \frac{(551 - 898.2)^2}{898.2}= 1342.105
