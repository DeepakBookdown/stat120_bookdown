\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction to Statistics}

Welcome to the captivating world of statistics! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you'll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in data analysis, statistical inference, and randomness. Some of the areas we'll delve into include linear regression, experimental design, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and the bootstrap method.

Although statistics is a field that relies on mathematics, it stands apart as a distinct discipline. At the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you'll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it's crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learn basic principles of data analysis, and how data is produced and used in studies and experiments.
\item
  Understand role of variation and randomness. Understand principles of inference: confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
\item
  Develop ability to examine statistical arguments critically.
\item
  Learn how to use software (R/RStudio) to analyze data, create graphs, perform basic statistical tests
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-is-r}{%
\chapter{What is R?}\label{what-is-r}}

R is a free and open source statistical programming language that facilitates statistical computation. There are a myriad of application that can be done in R, thanks to a huge online support community and dedicated packages. However, R has no graphical user interface and it has to be run by typing commands into a text interface.

\hypertarget{what-is-rstudio}{%
\section{What is RStudio?}\label{what-is-rstudio}}

RStudio provides graphical interface to R! You can think of RStudio as a graphical front-end to R that that provides extra functionality. The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an essential component of this course.

\hypertarget{r-studio-server}{%
\section{R Studio Server}\label{r-studio-server}}

The quickest way to get started is to go to \url{https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu}, which opens an R Studio window in your web browser. Once logged in, I recommend that you do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Step 1: Create a folder for this course where you can save all of your work. In the Files window, click on New Folder.
\item
  Step 2: Click on Tools -\textgreater{} Global Options -\textgreater{} R Markdown. Then uncheck the box that says ``Show output inline\ldots{}''
\end{itemize}

(It is also possible to download RStudio on your own laptop. Instructions may be found at the end of this document.)

\hypertarget{rrstudio}{%
\section{R/RStudio}\label{rrstudio}}

The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an
essential component of this course. You have two options for using
RStudio:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{server version} of RStudio on the web at
  (\url{https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu}). The advantage of using the
  server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud,
  where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you
  can access your work from any computer on campus using a web
  browser. This server may run slow during peak days/hours. I also recommend
  you to download a local version of R server in your computer in case of rare outages.
\item
  A \textbf{local version} of RStudio installed on your machine. This
  option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this
  course demands. Using this version you can only store your files in your local machine. Additionally, we can save our work on GitHub. We will learn how to use GitHub in the beginning of the course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source. Please make sure that you have recently updated both R and RStudio.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{installing-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}}{Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}}\label{installing-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}}

\begin{quote}
Download the latest version of R: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Download the free Rstudio desktop version: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}
\end{quote}

Use the default download and install options for each. For R, download the ``precompiled binary'' distribution rather than the source code

\textbf{Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}

If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To check your version of R, run the command \texttt{getRversion()} and compare your version to the newest version posted on \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.
\item
  In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option \texttt{Help\ \textgreater{}\ Check\ for\ updates}. Follow directions if an update is needed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update)}

Do whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch
RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png}{here},
but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code
or made any figures yet!

Put your cursor in the pane labeled \emph{Console}, which is where you
interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
like \texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ 2\ *\ 4} (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the
\texttt{x} object by typing \texttt{x} followed by enter or return. You should see
the value \texttt{8} printed. If this happened, you've succeeded in
installing R and RStudio!

\hypertarget{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}{%
\section{Install LaTeX (for knitting R Markdown documents to PDF):}\label{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}}

You need a Latex compiler to create a pdf document from a R Markdown file. If you use the maize server, you don't need to install anything. If you are using a local RStudio, you should install a Latex compiler. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.tug.org/mactex/}{MacTeX} for Mac (3.2GB)
\item
  \href{https://miktex.org/download}{MiKTeX} for Windows (190MB)
\item
  Alternatively, you can install the \texttt{tinytex} R package by running
  \texttt{install.packages("tinytex")} in the console.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize2-server}{%
\section{Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize2 server)}\label{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize2-server}}

If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To check your version of R, run the command \texttt{getRversion()} and compare your version to the newest version posted on \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.
\item
  In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option \texttt{Help\ \textgreater{}\ Check\ for\ updates}. Follow directions if an update is needed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{opening-a-new-file}{%
\section{Opening a new file}\label{opening-a-new-file}}

If using Rstudio on your computer, using the \textbf{File\textgreater Open File} menu to find and open this .Rmd file.

If using Maize Rstudio from your browser:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the Files tab, select \textbf{Upload} and \textbf{Choose File} to find the .Rmd that you downloaded. Click \emph{OK} to upload to your course folder/location in the maize server account.
\item
  Click on the .Rmd file in the appropriate folder to open the file.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{running-codes-and-knitting-.rmd-files}{%
\section{Running codes and knitting .Rmd files:}\label{running-codes-and-knitting-.rmd-files}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You can run a line of code by placing your cursor in the line of code and clicking \textbf{Run Selected Line(s)}
\item
  You can run an entire chunk by clicking the green triangle on the right side of the code chunk.
\item
  After each small edit or code addition, \textbf{Knit} your Markdown. If you wait until the end to Knit, it will be harder to find errors in your work.
\item
  Format output type: You can use any of pdf\_document, html\_document type, or word\_document type.
\item
  \textbf{Maize users}: You may also need to allow for ``pop-up'' in your web browser when knitting documents.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{few-more-instructions}{%
\section{Few More Instructions}\label{few-more-instructions}}

The default setting in Rstudio when you are running chunks is that the ``output'' (numbers, graphs) are
shown \textbf{inline} within the Markdown Rmd. If you prefer to have your plots appear on the right of the console and not below the chunk, then change the settings as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select Tools \textgreater{} Global Options.
\item
  Click the R Markdown section and uncheck (if needed) the option Show output inline for all
  R Markdown documents.
\item
  Click OK.
\end{enumerate}

Now try running R chunks in the .Rmd file to see the difference. You can recheck this box if you prefer
the default setting.

\hypertarget{vpn}{%
\section{VPN}\label{vpn}}

If you plan to do any work off campus this term, you need to install Carleton's VPN. This will allow you to access the \textbf{maize} server (if needed).

\textbf{Installing the GlobalProtect VPN}

Follow the directions \href{https://wiki.carleton.edu/display/itskb/GlobalProtect+VPN}{here} to install VPN.

\hypertarget{r-markdown-basics}{%
\chapter{R Markdown Basics}\label{r-markdown-basics}}

An R Markdown file (.Rmd file) combines R commands and written analyses, which are `knit' together into an HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word document.

An R Markdown file contains three essential elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Header: The header (top) of the file contains information like the document title, author, date and your preferred output format (pdf\_document, word\_document, or html\_document).
\item
  Written analysis: You write up your analysis after the header and embed R code where needed. The online help below shows ways to add formatting details like bold words, lists, section labels, etc to your final pdf/word/html document. For example, adding ** before and after a word will bold that word in your compiled document.
\item
  R chunks: R chunks contain the R commands that you want evaluated. You embed these chunks within your written analysis and they are evaluated when you compile the document.
\end{itemize}

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

\hypertarget{r-markdown-syntax}{%
\section{R Markdown Syntax}\label{r-markdown-syntax}}

\hypertarget{lists-in-r-markdown}{%
\subsection{Lists in R Markdown:}\label{lists-in-r-markdown}}

You can use asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as \texttt{*italics*\ or\ **bold**}. You can create lists with a dash:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{2}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{3}
  \SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ Subitem }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

to produce

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Item 1
\item
  Item 2
\item
  Item 3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Subitem 1
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Item 4
\end{itemize}

You can embed Latex equations in-line, \texttt{\$\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\}\ \textbackslash{}sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}\{n\}\ x\_\{i\}\$} to produce \(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\) or in a new line as \texttt{\$\$\textbackslash{}text\{Var\}(X)\ =\ \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n-1\}\textbackslash{}sum\_\{i-1\}\^{}\{n\}\ (x\_\{i\}\ -\ \textbackslash{}bar\{x\})\^{}2\$\$} to produce \[\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i-1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2\]

\hypertarget{embed-an-r-code-chunk}{%
\subsection{Embed an R code chunk:}\label{embed-an-r-code-chunk}}

Use the following

\chapter{Report Guidelines}\label{report-guidelines}}

The data analysis report that you will be writing for this class will ask two things of you:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  use appropriate statistical methods to answer research questions and
\item
  clearly and concisely communicate the meaning of your statistics and graphs to a \textbf{reader} who has a basic knowledge of statistics.
\end{enumerate}

Your report should be organized, well-written with proper use of grammar, and contain sound reasoning and correct interpretations of statistical evidence. Also include \emph{at least one} graphical display of your data on the body of your report. Be sure to hide the code used to produce it!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Your lab reports should be organized into the following sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Introduction:} describe the data and your research questions
  \item
    \textbf{Results:} describe your statistical analysis and interpret your graphs and numbers
  \item
    \textbf{Discussion:} summarize your findings and answer your research questions, describe any limitations of
    your analysis
  \item
    \textbf{Technical Appendix:} Staple all relevant R commands and output to the end of your written report. Only including commands without output is not enough. You must appropriately comment your code (telling me what each section of code is doing), and edit your code and output (no typos or errors allowed).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type your report in Word/Google doc (or similar software) and use R (not Excel, Statkey or other software) for your analysis. You can also use R Markdown to write up your reports but you need to take care to only include labeled and numbered graphical output from R in the main document. Commands and numerical output should be placed in the Technical Appendix. If you are interested in using Markdown talk to me for hints on its use for reports.
\item
  Carefully decide \textbf{appropriate graphs and numbers} to include. There is no need to show the same data in different forms (e.g.~no need to show both a histogram and boxplot for the same variable). You also don't need to include all numbers given in R output if you only use a few in your analysis. You also don't need to ``show'' (or prove) skewness or outliers using numbers, just use your graphs to display skewness or outliers.
\item
  \textbf{Interpret} and give meaning to \textbf{all} graphs and numbers that you choose to include in your report. Do not include algebraic calculations or too much technical detail.
\item
  \textbf{Including Numbers:} \textbf{Never include R numerical output or commands}. Summarize needed output in a nicely formatted Word table or just integrate numbers into your writing. In you include tables, label them numerically (Table 1, Table 2, etc) and give each a title. Number in order of how they appear in the paper and refer to these tables by their number (``Table 1 displays summary statistics for income.'').
\item
  \textbf{Including Graphs:} Resize all graphs appropriately so they fit nicely into your written report. Large graphs that take up most of a page with no, or very little, writing on the page impede the flow of the report and reduce its readability. Label all graphs numerically (Figure 1, etc.) as they occur in the paper, give each a title and refer to by number. See the stats lab manual chapter 1 if you need help copying plots into a Word/google doc.
\item
  \textbf{Do not explain every step taken in your study.} For example, there is no need to include a statement such as ``I used R to create a histogram of income and observed that the distribution was right skewed''. Instead just say ``The distribution of income is skewed to the right (Figure 1)``.
\item
  Avoid using weak phrases like ``The average height of men is higher than the average for women.'' \textbf{Use numbers to bolster your explanation:} ``The average height of men is three inches more than the average for women (68.5 vs.~65.5 inches).''
\item
  The \textbf{precision} of your data should dictate the precision of your statistics. In general, your statistics can have one to two more significant digits than your data. For example, if height is recorded to the nearest inch then the mean height should be reported as 65.5 (or 65.49) rather than the R value of 65.49268.
\item
  Sometimes a question posed in a study is \textbf{ambiguous} and there may be more than one way to correctly answer to the question. In grading your reports and paper, \textbf{I am most concerned with the logic of your conclusions and how you support your claim using data and statistical evidence.}
