Click for answer

\emph{Answer:}

This study aimed to measure the effects of psychological biases on estimates of compliance with public health guidance regarding COVID-19. Results showed that compliance estimates were reduced when questions were framed negatively and anonymity was increased. Effect sizes were large, with compliance estimates diminishing by up to 17\% points and 10\% points, respectively. These findings suggest that standard tracking surveys pose questions in ways that lead to higher compliance estimates than alternative approaches.

\hypertarget{gettysburg-random-sample}{%
\subsection{Gettysburg random sample}\label{gettysburg-random-sample}}

Let's take a simple random sample (SRS) of Gettysburg words. The ``population'' is contained in the
spreadsheet \texttt{GettysburgPopulationCounts.csv}. Carefully load this data into R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pop }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/GettysbergPopulationCounts.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  position size  word
1        1    4  Four
2        2    5 score
3        3    3   and
4        4    5 seven
5        5    5 years
6        6    3  ago,
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{position} variable enumerates the list of words in the population (address).

(a). Sample

Run the following command to obtain a SRS of 10 words from the 268 that are in the population:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{samp }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{sample}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{268}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{size=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{samp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1]  88 111  46  41  80   6 190  44 164 107
\end{verbatim}

This tells you the position (row number) of your sampled words. What are your sampled positions? Why are your sampled positions different from other folks in class?

(b). Get words and lengths

We will \emph{subset} the data set \texttt{pop} to obtain only the sampled rows listed in \texttt{samp}. We do this using \textbf{square bracket notation} `dataset{[}row number, column number/name{]}. Run the following command to find your sampled words and sizes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pop[samp,]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
    position size    word
88        88    4    that

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute your sample mean
\end{enumerate}

The word lengths in part (b) are the data for your sample. You can compute your sample mean using a calculator, or using R. Let's try R (you will find it faster!). First save the quantitative variable \texttt{size} in a new variable called \texttt{mysize}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mysize }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ pop[samp, }\StringTok{"size"}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{mysize}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 [1] 4 2 6 7 3 3 3 2 2 5
\end{verbatim}

Then find the mean of these values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(mysize)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 3.7
\end{verbatim}

How does this sample mean (from a truly random sample) compare to your sample mean from the non-random sample?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The true mean is 4.29. Your two means will likely vary. Since the many non-random samples generally overestimated the population mean length, it is possible (but not guaranteed) that \emph{your} one non-random sample gave a mean length that is greater than the random sample's mean length.

Over 30,000 people participated in an online poll on \texttt{cnn.com} conducted in April 2012 asking: ``Have you ever driven with a pet on your lap''? We see that 34\% of the participants answered yes and 66\% answered no.

\item
  Can you conclude that a random sample was used from the description given? Explain.
\end{enumerate}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} No you can't make this conclusion from the info given. In fact, an online poll at a website like \texttt{cnn.com} is almost always reporting results from a non-random sample. The people who respond are individuals who visit \texttt{cnn.com}, then see the online poll and decide to respond.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Explain why it is not appropriate to generalize these results to all drivers, or even to all drivers who visit cnn.com.
\end{enumerate}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} This is a volunteer sample, and volunteer samples are often biased and can't be generalized to \emph{all drivers} (the population). It is likely that people who have driven with a pet on their lap are more likely to respond to the poll.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  How might we select a sample of people that would give us results that we can generalize to a broader population?
\end{enumerate}

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} A random sample of individuals from all U.S. drivers would need to be selected and given the poll question. (There are many ways to do this, the most common being a variation of random digit dialing where phone numbers are randomly selected from known area codes.)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}

\item
  Is the variable measured in this study quantitative or categorical?

\section{Case Study 1}\label{case-study-1}}

Consider the following case study:

``Swimming with dolphins can certainly be fun, but is it also therapeutic for patients suffering from clinical depression? To investigate this possibility, researchers recruited 30 subjects aged 18-65 with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate depression. Subjects were required to discontinue use of any antidepressant drugs or psychotherapy four weeks prior to the experiment, and throughout the experiment. These 30 subjects went to an island off the coast of Honduras, where they were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Both groups engaged in the same amount of swimming and snorkeling each day, but one group (the animal care program) did so in the presence of bottlenose dolphins and the other group (outdoor nature program) did not. At the end of two weeks, each subjects' level of depression was evaluated, as it had been at the beginning of the study, and it was determined whether they showed substantial improvement (reducing their level of depression) by the end of the study (Antonioli and Reveley, 2005).''

Observed data:

The researchers found that 10 of 15 subjects in the dolphin therapy group showed substantial improvement, compared to 3 of 15 subjects in the control group.

(a). Identify the observational units in this study.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The observational units in this study are the 30 subjects.

(b). Classify each variable as categorical or quantitative.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The variables in this study can be classified as follows:
Categorical: Treatment Group (Dolphin and Control)
Quantitative: Age, Level of Depression (Beginning and End of Study)

(c). Which variable would you regard as explanatory and which as response?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The explanatory variable would be the Treatment Group and the response variable would be the Level of Depression.

(d). Is this an observational study or an experiment? Justify your answer.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} This is an experiment because the researchers randomly assigned the subjects to the two treatment groups, and then observed the effect of the treatment (presence of dolphins) on the response variable (level of depression).

For this study, the researchers recruited 200 subjects which will be grouped into 100 pairs based on shared characteristics such as age, gender, weight, height, lifestyle, and so on. A 20-year-old female within the weight range of 90-110 pounds and the height range of 60-63 inches will be paired with another 20-year-old female that falls into the same weight and height categories. Once all 100 pairs are made, a subject from each pair will be randomly assigned into the treatment group (will be administered the new diet for 2 months) while the other subject from the pair will be assigned to the control group (will be assigned to follow the standard diet for two months). At the end of the time time period of 2 months, researchers will measure the total weight gain for each subject.''

Observed data:

The researchers found that 60 of 100 subjects in the new diet group showed substantial improvement, compared to 43 of 100 subjects in the standard diet group.

(a). Identify the observational units in this study.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The observational units in this study are the 200 subjects.

(b). Classify each variable as categorical or quantitative.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The variables are: age (quantitative), gender (categorical), weight (quantitative), height (quantitative), lifestyle (categorical), and total weight gain (quantitative).

(c). Which variable would you regard as explanatory and which as response?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} The explanatory variable is the type of diet (new or standard) and the response variable is the total weight gain.

(d). Is this an observational study or an experiment? Justify your answer.

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} This is an experiment because the researchers are manipulating the explanatory variables (type of diet) to observe the effects on the response variables (total weight gain).

(e). If it is an experiment, is it randomized comparative experiment or a matched pairs experiment?

Click for answer

\emph{Answer:} This is a matched pairs experiment because each subject is paired with another subject who has similar characteristics and one subject from each pair is randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group.

(f). Construct a two-way table based on the results of the experiment.

\chapter{What is R?}\label{what-is-r}}

R is a free and open source statistical programming language that facilitates statistical computation. There are a myriad of application that can be done in R, thanks to a huge online support community and dedicated packages. However, R has no graphical user interface and it has to be run by typing commands into a text interface.

\hypertarget{what-is-rstudio}{%
\section{What is RStudio?}\label{what-is-rstudio}}

RStudio provides graphical interface to R! You can think of RStudio as a graphical front-end to R that that provides extra functionality. The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an essential component of this course.

\hypertarget{r-studio-server}{%
\section{R Studio Server}\label{r-studio-server}}

The quickest way to get started is to go to \url{https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu}, which opens an R Studio window in your web browser. Once logged in, I recommend that you do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Step 1: Create a folder for this course where you can save all of your work. In the Files window, click on New Folder.
\item
  Step 2: Click on Tools -\textgreater{} Global Options -\textgreater{} R Markdown. Then uncheck the box that says ``Show output inline\ldots{}''
\end{itemize}

(It is also possible to download RStudio on your own laptop. Instructions may be found at the end of this document.)

\hypertarget{r-markdown-basics}{%
\section{R Markdown Basics}\label{r-markdown-basics}}

An R Markdown file (.Rmd file) combines R commands and written analyses, which are `knit' together into an HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word document.

An R Markdown file contains three essential elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Header: The header (top) of the file contains information like the document title, author, date and your preferred output format (pdf\_document, word\_document, or html\_document).
\item
  Written analysis: You write up your analysis after the header and embed R code where needed. The online help below shows ways to add formatting details like bold words, lists, section labels, etc to your final pdf/word/html document. For example, adding ** before and after a word will bold that word in your compiled document.
\item
  R chunks: R chunks contain the R commands that you want evaluated. You embed these chunks within your written analysis and they are evaluated when you compile the document.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Use the default download and install options for each.

\hypertarget{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}{%
\section{Install LaTeX (for knitting R Markdown documents to PDF):}\label{install-latex-for-knitting-r-markdown-documents-to-pdf}}

If you want to compile R Markdown to .pdf files, you also need a LaTeX distribution (Note: this is not necessary if you choose to compile as a Word document.) Click \href{http://www.miktex.org/}{instructions for Windows} or \href{https://tug.org/mactex/}{instructions for Mac}, depending on your operating system to complete the installation.

\hypertarget{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}{%
\section{Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)}\label{updating-rrstudio-not-needed-if-you-are-using-the-maize-server}}

If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To check your version of R, run the command \texttt{getRversion()} and compare your version to the newest version posted on \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.
\item
  In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option \texttt{Help\ \textgreater{}\ Check\ for\ updates}. Follow directions if an update is needed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{instructions}{%
\section{Instructions}\label{instructions}}

If using Rstudio on your computer, using the \textbf{File\textgreater Open File} menu to find and open this .Rmd file.

If using Maize Rstudio from your browser:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the Files tab, select \textbf{Upload} and \textbf{Choose File} to find the .Rmd that you downloaded. Click \emph{OK} to upload to your course folder/location in the maize server account.
\item
  Click on the .Rmd file in the appropriate folder to open the file.
\end{itemize}

Extra notes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You can run a line of code by placing your cursor in the line of code and clicking \textbf{Run Selected Line(s)}
\item
  You can run an entire chunk by clicking the green triangle on the right side of the code chunk.
\item
  After each small edit or code addition, \textbf{Knit} your Markdown. If you wait until the end to Knit, it will be harder to find errors in your work.
\item
  Format output type: You can use any of pdf\_document, html\_document type, or word\_document type.
\item
  \textbf{Maize users}: You may also need to allow for ``pop-up'' in your web browser when knitting documents.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{few-more-instructions}{%
\section{Few More Instructions}\label{few-more-instructions}}

The default setting in Rstudio when you are running chunks is that the ``output'' (numbers, graphs) are
shown \textbf{inline} within the Markdown Rmd. If you prefer to have your plots appear on the right of the console and not below the chunk, then change the settings as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select Tools \textgreater{} Global Options.
\item
  Click the R Markdown section and uncheck (if needed) the option Show output inline for all
  R Markdown documents.
\item
  Click OK.
\end{enumerate}

Now try running R chunks in the .Rmd file to see the difference. You can recheck this box if you prefer
the default setting.

This is a R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

You can use asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as \texttt{*italics*\ or\ **bold**}.

You can create lists with a dash:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{2}
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{3}
  \SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ Subitem }\DecValTok{1}
\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ Item }\DecValTok{4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\item
  Item 3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Subitem 1
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Item 4
\end{itemize}

You can embed Latex equations in-line, \(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\) or in a new line as

\[\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i-1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2 \]
\#\# Embed an R code chunk:

Use

\begin{verbatim}
```r
Use back ticks to 
create a block of code
```
\end{verbatim}

to produce:

\begin{verbatim}
Use back ticks to 
create a block of code
\end{verbatim}

You can also evaluate and display the results of R code. Each tasks can be accomplished in a suitably labeled chunk like the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(cars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
