# Practice Problems 3



## Case Study 1

Consider the following case study:


<bql>
“Researchers want to find out how a new diet affects weight gain among underweight subjects. This experiment only has two treatment conditions, the new diet and the standard diet. For this study, the researchers recruited 200 subjects which will be grouped into 100 pairs based on shared characteristics such as age, gender, weight, height, lifestyle, and so on.  A 20-year-old female within the weight range of 90-110 pounds and the height range of 60-63 inches will be paired with another 20-year-old female that falls into the same weight and height categories.  Once all 100 pairs are made, a subject from each pair will be randomly assigned into the treatment group (will be administered the new diet for 2 months) while the other subject from the pair will be assigned to the control group (will be assigned to follow the standard diet for two months). At the end of the time time period of 2 months, researchers will measure the total weight gain for each subject.”</bql>

Observed data:

<bql>
The researchers found that 60 of 100 subjects in the new diet group showed substantial improvement, compared to 43 of 100 subjects in the standard diet group.

(a). Identify the experimental units in this study. 
<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* The experimental units in this study are the 200 subjects. 
</details>
<br>

(b). Classify each variable as categorical or quantitative. 

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* The variables are: age (quantitative), gender (categorical), weight (quantitative), height (quantitative), lifestyle (categorical), and total weight gain (quantitative). 
</details>
<br>

(c). Which variable would you regard as explanatory and which as response? 

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* The explanatory variable is the type of diet (new or standard) and the response variable is the total weight gain.
</details>
<br>

(d). Is this an observational study or an experiment? Justify your answer.

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* This is an experiment because the researchers are manipulating the explanatory variables (type of diet) to observe the effects on the response variables (total weight gain).
</details>
<br>

(e). If it is an experiment, is it randomized comparative experiment or a matched pairs experiment?

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* This is a matched pairs experiment because each subject is paired with another subject who has similar characteristics and one subject from each pair is randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. More specifically, this is a $pretest - posttest$ matched pairs design.
</details>

(f). Construct a two-way table based on the results of the experiment.

Two-way table:

Outcome  | New Diet |	Standard Diet | 	Total
------------------|----------|--------------|------
Improvement |	60 | 	43 |	103
No Improvement |	40 |	57 |	97
Total |	100 |	100 |	200
</details>

## Case Study 2

Consider the following case study:


<bql>
“In a psychology class, researchers want to know which method of study yields higher exam scores. The class has 50 students who all agree to participate. Each student will first study for Exam 1 using traditional textbook reading and then take the exam. Afterward, the same students will study for Exam 2 using interactive online modules and take that exam. The order of study techniques is kept the same to eliminate the impact of subject matter difficulty. Exam scores are the outcome of interest.”</bql>


(a). Identify the experimental units in this study. 
<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* The experimental units are the individual students.
</details>
<br>

(b). Classify each variable as categorical or quantitative. 

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* "Study technique" is categorical, and "exam score" is quantitative. 
</details>
<br>

(c). Which variable would you regard as explanatory and which as response? 

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* "Study technique" is the explanatory variable, and "exam score" is the response variable.
</details>
<br>

(d). Is this an observational study or an experiment? Justify your answer.

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* This is an experiment because the researchers are imposing treatments (study techniques) on the subjects to observe the effects on exam scores.


</details>
<br>

(e). If it is an experiment, is it randomized comparative experiment or a matched pairs experiment?

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* This is a matched pairs experiment with repeated measures, as each student experiences both treatments and serves as their own control.
</details>

(g). Construct a two-way table based on the results of the experiment.

<details>
<summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
| Exam Score Range | Textbook Study | Interactive Online Module |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $90-100$ | 12 | 20 |
| $80-89$ | 15 | 18 |
| $70-79$ | 10 | 7 |
| $60-69$ | 8 | 3 |
| Below 60 | 5 | 2 |
| Total | $\mathbf{5 0}$ | $\mathbf{5 0}$ |
