# Class Activity 10


## Example 1: Extrasensory Perception (ESP)

In an ESP test, one person writes down one of the letters A, B, C, D, or E and tries to telepathically communicate the choice to a partner.  The partner then tries to guess what letter was selected. 


### (a) Repeat this a couple of times, then switch roles with your partner. How often did you guess correctly? 

*Answer:*  Answers will vary!

### (b)  If there is no ESP and people are just randomly guessing from among the five choices, what proportion of guesses would we expect to be correct? If no ESP, we expect p = $\ldots$

*Answer:* $p = 0.2$ (since there are five choices and they are randomly guessing)

### (c) Which sample proportion correct would provide the greatest evidence that people have ESP:   (If we assume the sample size is the same in every case.)


*Answer:* 

$\hat{p} = 3/4$ since this means more correct.


### (d)  Write down the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether people have ESP:

*Answer:* 

$$H_0: p = 0.2$$
$$H_a: p > 0.2$$
where $p$ is the proportion correct for all people's guesses. Since we are looking for evidence that the proportion is significantly above 0.2 (random guesses), the alternate hypothesis is larger than.


## Example 2

In an experiment, students were given words to memorize, then were randomly assigned to either take a 90 minute nap or take a caffeine pill.  A couple hours later, they were tested on their recall ability.  We wish to test to see if the sample provides evidence that there is a difference in mean number of words people can recall depending on whether they take a nap or have some caffeine.  

### (a) What is the explanatory variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?

*Answer:* Explanatory = nap or caffeine (categorical)

### (b) What is the response variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?

*Answer:* Response = number of words recalled (quantitative)

### (c) What is the parameter of interest for this experiment? Use correct notation.

*Answer:* 

Quantitative = mean responses, where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the mean words recalled in the two different conditions


### (d) What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this test? Use correct notation.

*Answer:* 

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
$$H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

The alternate hypothesis is not equals to since we are looking for evidence that the means are different (We do not know which one is larger!)


## Example 3: Guess the inference method!

For each question below, indicate whether it is best assessed with a confidence interval, hypothesis test, or whether statistical inference is not needed to answer it.  If inference is used, define the population parameter(s) of interest and indicate your hypotheses if a test is appropriate. Use correct notation.

### (a) What proportion of US adults support gun control?

*Answer:* Estimating a population parameter with a confidence interval: p: proportion of US adults who support gun control

### (b) Does the proportion of people who support gun control differ between males and females?

*Answer:* Testing the claim of a difference:

$$p_f: \text{proportion of females who support gun control}$$
$$p_m: \text{proportion of males who support gun control}$$

$$H_0: p_f = p_m$$
$$H_a: p_f \neq p_m$$


### (c) What proportion of this class supports gun control?

*Answer:* 

Neither, just collect data on the entire population (class) to answer this question.

### (d) How much more do men earn, on average, compared to women in the US?

*Answer:* How much means an estimate: confidence interval for $\mu_m - \mu_f$

$$\mu_f: \text{mean income (yearly) of US females}$$
$$\mu_m: \text{mean income (yearly) of US males}$$

### (e) What proportion of Minnesota voters in the 2012 election voted for President Obama?

*Answer:* Neither, this number is computed from voting records.

### (f) Is a higher rate of cricket chirping associated with higher summer night temps? 

*Answer:* 

Test a claim about an association:

$$H_0: \rho = 0 \text{ or } \beta_1 = 0$$

$$H_a: \rho > 0 \text{ or } \beta_1 > 0$$

$$\rho : \text{correlatio nbetween temp and chirp rate}$$

$$\beta_1 : \text{change in temp for a unit increase in chirp rate}$$

## Example 1 Revisited: 

### (a) If the results of a test for ESP are statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of ESP?

*Answer:* 

It means we can conclude that $p > 0.2$ and that the sample results were so strong that we can conclude that ESP does exist and get more right than would be expected by random chance.  

### (b) If the results are not statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of ESP?

*Answer:* 

The sample results are inconclusive.  People may or may not have ESP. Sample results could be just random chance.

## Example 2 Revisited:

### (a) If the results of the test comparing sleep and caffeine for memory are statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of sleep, caffeine, and memory?

*Answer:* We can state that there is a difference between sleep and caffeine in their effectiveness at helping word recall.

### (b) If the results are not statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of sleep, caffeine, and memory? 

*Answer:* It means the sample results are inconclusive and we canâ€™t tell if there is a difference.  Results might just be random chance.
