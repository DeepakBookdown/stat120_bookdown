# Welcome to LaTeX Mastery! ðŸš€

Hey there, aspiring LaTeX pros! Ready to make your equations look as sleek as a Tesla? Let's get started!

## Inline Equations

For quick math snippets, use single `$` like `$y = a + b * x$`.

Example: The equation $y = a + b * x$ represents a linear model.

## Display-Style Equations

To give your equation the spotlight, encase it with double `$$`:

```latex
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```

## Mathematical Symbols

### Summation and Indices

In stats, you often sum things up: 
- `$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$` 

### Fractions

- Simple fraction: `$$ \frac{a}{b} $$`

### Greek Letters and Subscripts

Common in hypothesis testing and statistical theory:

- Mean of a group: `$$ \mu_Y $$`, `$$ \mu_N $$`
- Sample means: `$$ \bar{x}_N $$`, `$$ \bar{x}_Y $$`
- Proportions: `$$ \hat{p} $$`
  
## Matrices and Vectors

Matrices are a breeze in LaTeX:

```latex
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
```

## Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis testing, you might define null and alternative hypotheses:

```latex
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: & \mu_N=\mu_Y \\
H_a: & \mu_N>\mu_Y
\end{array}
\end{align*}
```

## More on Statistical Symbols

- Standard error: `$$ SE $$`
- Population proportion: `$$ p $$`
- Margin of error: `$$ \pm $$`
- Confidence level: `$$ 95\% $$`

That's all for now! Ready to LaTeX like a pro? ðŸŽ‰
