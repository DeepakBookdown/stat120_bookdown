## Problem 1

---------------------------------------------------

a. Run the following chunk. Comment on the output.


```r
example_data = data.frame(ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
                          Greeting = c(rep("Hello", 5), rep("Goodbye",5)),
                          Male = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5),
                          Weight = runif(n=10, 50, 300))
```

```r
example_data
```

```
   ID Greeting  Male   Weight
1   1    Hello  TRUE 274.2463
2   2    Hello FALSE 142.2812
3   3    Hello  TRUE 221.5620
4   4    Hello FALSE 228.8303
5   5    Hello  TRUE 270.2057
6   6  Goodbye FALSE 267.0193
7   7  Goodbye  TRUE 164.6848
8   8  Goodbye FALSE 170.3278
9   9  Goodbye  TRUE 109.0457
10 10  Goodbye FALSE 286.0813
```

*Answer:* We see a data frame with four columns, where the first column is an `identifier` for the cases. We have information on the greeting types, whether male or not, and weight on these cases in the remaining columns.
