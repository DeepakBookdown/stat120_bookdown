### Example 1: Extrasensory Perception (ESP)

In an ESP test, one person writes down one of the letters A, B, C, D, or E and tries to telepathically communicate the choice to a partner.  The partner then tries to guess what letter was selected. 


 (a). Repeat this a couple of times, then switch roles with your partner. How often did you guess correctly?

*Answer:*  Answers will vary!
</details><br>

 (b).  If there is no ESP and people are just randomly guessing from among the five choices, what proportion of guesses would we expect to be correct? If no ESP, we expect p = $\ldots$
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* $p = 0.2$ (since there are five choices and they are randomly guessing)
</details><br>

 (c). Which sample proportion correct would provide the greatest evidence that people have ESP:   (If we assume the sample size is the same in every case.)

<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 
$\hat{p} = 3/4$ since this means more correct.
</details><br>

 (d).  Write down the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether people have ESP:
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 
$$H_0: p = 0.2$$
$$H_a: p > 0.2$$
where $p$ is the proportion correct for all people's guesses. Since we are looking for evidence that the proportion is significantly above 0.2 (random guesses), the alternate hypothesis is larger than.

### Example 2

In an experiment, students were given words to memorize, then were randomly assigned to either take a 90 minute nap or take a caffeine pill.  A couple hours later, they were tested on their recall ability.  We wish to test to see if the sample provides evidence that there is a difference in mean number of words people can recall depending on whether they take a nap or have some caffeine.  

 (a). What is the explanatory variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* Explanatory = nap or caffeine (categorical)
</details><br>

 (b). What is the response variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* Response = number of words recalled (quantitative)
</details><br>

 (c). What is the parameter of interest for this experiment? Use correct notation.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 
Quantitative = mean responses, where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the mean words recalled in the two different conditions
</details><br>

 (d). What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this test? Use correct notation.
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
$$H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

The alternate hypothesis is not equals to since we are looking for evidence that the means are different (We do not know which one is larger!)

### Example 1 Revisited: 

 (a). If the results of a test for ESP are statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of ESP?
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 

It means we can conclude that $p > 0.2$ and that the sample results were so strong that we can conclude that ESP does exist and get more right than would be expected by random chance.  
</details><br>

 (b). If the results are not statistically significant, what does that mean in terms of ESP?
<details><summary><red>Click for answer</red></summary>
*Answer:* 

The sample results are inconclusive.  People may or may not have ESP. Sample results could be just random chance.
